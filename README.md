## 🌟 About Me  

- I am a Master’s student in Operational Research with a strong interest in
  optimization methods and computational approaches to decision-making.  
- My work currently focuses on linear programming problems, optimization
  techniques, and algorithmic methods in Operations Research, with the use of
  statistical techniques such as least squares and curve fitting.  
- I use this GitHub profile to document academic projects, coursework-related
  work, and numerical experiments.
